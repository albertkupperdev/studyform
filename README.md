# Studyform

> Reading that becomes recall.

Studyform turns PDFs and web pages into high-quality spaced-repetition flashcards using AI. The focus is on card quality — every card is grounded in the source text, not generated from thin air.

**Live demo:** https://studyform.vercel.app

---

## Features

- Upload a PDF or paste a URL
- Extracts and chunks the source text before generation — this is the quality lever
- Generates 2–4 flashcards per chunk using Llama 3.3 70B via Groq
- Reviews cards using the SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm
- Magic link authentication — no passwords

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Auth + Database | Supabase |
| AI | Groq — `llama-3.3-70b-versatile` |
| PDF parsing | unpdf |
| Spaced repetition | SM-2 (custom implementation) |
| Deployment | Vercel |

## Architecture

```
User uploads PDF or URL
  ↓
Text extracted server-side (unpdf / cheerio)
  ↓
Text split into semantic chunks (lib/chunker.ts)
  ↓
Each chunk → Groq LLM → 2–4 flashcards (lib/prompts.ts)
  ↓
Cards stored in Supabase, linked to source chunk
  ↓
SM-2 algorithm schedules reviews (lib/sm2.ts)
```

Chunking before generation is the core architectural decision. A card generated from a tightly-scoped passage is grounded. A card generated from a full document is a hallucination risk.

## Database Schema

```
documents    — one per upload, owned by a user
chunks       — text segments extracted from a document
cards        — front/back pairs, each linked to a chunk
card_reviews — SM-2 state per card per user (ease_factor, interval, due_date)
```

Row Level Security is enabled on all tables. Users can only access their own data.

## Running Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/albertkupperdev/studyform
cd studyform
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Fill in `.env.local`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
GROQ_API_KEY=
```

Run the SQL in `supabase/schema.sql` in your Supabase project's SQL editor, then:

```bash
npm run dev
```
